# Blazor Aspire Demos 

## Requirements
- This demo uses Docker Desktop: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/

## Overview
- The demos contain examples/links on how to use some of the NuGet packages I have created.
- It also contains a couple of 'How To' examples on things I found useful in Blazor.

### .NET 10.0 - Under Construction
- ../src/Aspire/10
- Aspire does not yet support .NET 10.0
- Projects will be upgraded to use Aspire when it supports .NET 10.0.
- For now, the demo is configured for a multiple project startup with the ApiService and WebApp.
- Some of the .NET 9.0 demos will not be available until Aspire supports .NET 10.0.

### .NET 9.0
- ../src/Aspire/09
